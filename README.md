Control Heatpump via pythonscript using Eplucon website

Hello,

I am a big fan of using Home Assistant and was disappointed about the integration possibilities with the Ecoforest Heatpump which i own.
The app and the website as offered by theprovider could be used and that was it. So i started with scraping the site to read informaiton to prsent it in Home Assistant.
Luckiliy they cam with an API providing json te read data. However there was and is still no possbility to change for example the temperature or the mode except using the app or the website.
